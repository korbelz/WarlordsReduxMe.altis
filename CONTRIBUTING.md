# Guidelines for Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from the community, as they help improve the quality and functionality of our work. To ensure a smooth and efficient collaboration process, we have established some guidelines that we kindly request that you follow. 

1. Fork the Repository: Start by forking the project repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the project that you can freely modify.

2. Create a Branch: For each contribution, create a new branch in your forked repository. This will help keep your changes isolated and make it easier for us to review them.

3. Make Your Changes: Implement the desired modifications or additions in your branch. Follow our coding style guidelines and ensure that your changes align with the project's purpose and objectives.

4. Commit and Push: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch and push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

5. Submit a Pull Request: Go to the original project repository and submit a pull request (PR) from your branch. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made and explain their purpose.

6. Review Process: All contributions undergo a review process to maintain the quality and integrity of the project. Our designated reviewers, Gamerdad and MrThomasM, will carefully assess your changes, provide feedback, and suggest any necessary improvements.

7. Code security: We are far from making the mission fully secured against cheaters, but we try our hardest to make the mission more secure with each update. To avoid going one step forwards and two steps backward, no insecure code is allowed into the mission. The use of the argument that there is already insecure code in the mission to support your code being merged is something we don't believe in. We need to focus on making our security better with each update. If we do not find any other way to make the mission more secure at some point, then we can look at minimizing our vulnerabilities. But to make this point clear, at no point will insecure code be allowed in the mission.

8. Address Feedback: If your contribution requires revisions based on the review, make the necessary changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository. The pull request will be automatically updated.

9. Merge and Acknowledgment: Once your contribution has been reviewed and approved, one of our project maintainers will merge your changes into the main repository. You will be duly acknowledged for your valuable contribution.

Please note that while we strive to review contributions promptly, it may take some time depending on the volume of submissions. We appreciate your patience and understanding throughout the process.

Thank you for your dedication and support in improving our project. We look forward to your valuable contributions!
